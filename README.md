This thesis focuses on the needs of elderly citizens in the Greek region and aims to analyze the placement of non-urgent healthcare facilities, consequently 
optimizing accessibility to medical services.

To solve the aforementioned problem, the discrete location model, specifically the p-median optimization problem, is utilized. The p-median 
problem selects the optimal location, among existing healthcare structures, for the installation of medical teams, taking parameters such as distance 
and demand into account. 

The method employed to solve the p-median problem is the exact solution approach, which involves the 
technique of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization. Integer Linear Programming examines the entire solution space and selects the optimal solution. 

The main tools used for software development, i.e., implementing the p-median problem and the ILP optimization technique, are the Python programming language, 
specifically the pulp library.
